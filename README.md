# Java!

In this repo I showcase all of my learning towards mastering java. From the basics to algorithms and more. Through useful resources I was able to grasp these concepts seamlessly and transfer the knowledge to the project building
phase. BroCode on ðŸ“º YouTube helped really understand the inner workings of java and increase confidence towards my career in the software world.

Keep on coding!
